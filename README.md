My submission for #30DaysOfKotlin
=================================

It can be called my first proper app, and with having to study Kotlin programming language and app development from scratch in 30 days, 
it proved to be quite a challenge. This app is made in approximatelt 3 days and honestly, it was a hearty effort from my side. 

I also want to thank #30DaysOfKotlin for giving us this opportunity to learn so many new things. App development, though new for me, 
was very intriguing to learn and it was a good initiative.

The app is a Trivia Quiz on a few popular TV shows, and binge-watchers might really enjot it!
